 # üßæ 1.7-JavaAnnotations

A complete set of exercises focused on Java annotations, both built-in and custom.
This project demonstrates how to apply `@Override`, `@Deprecated`, and how to define and use custom annotations with Java Reflection

## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement
This repository contains the full solution for Sprint 1 - Annotations of the Java programming track.
The sprint is divided into three levels, gradually introducing annotation concepts, from basic overrides to custom annotations and runtime processing with reflection.

## üì¶ Level 1

### Exercise 1
Implements a class hierarchy with a base class Worker and two subclasses: OnlineWorker and OnSiteWorker.

The base class includes the fields: name, surname, and hourlyRate.
It provides a method calculateSalary(hoursWorked) that multiplies the hours by the hourly rate.
The subclasses override this method using the @Override annotation.
- OnSiteWorker includes a static field fuelBonus that is added to the result of the salary calculation.
- OnlineWorker includes a constant INTERNET_FLAT_RATE that is added to the salary.
The main() method in the Main class demonstrates the usage of the @Override annotation by invoking overridden methods.

### Exercise 2
Adds deprecated methods in the subclasses and marks them using the @Deprecated annotation.
From an external class, these methods are called.
The warning generated by using deprecated methods is suppressed using the appropriate annotation.

## üß¨ Level 2
### Exercise 1
Creates a custom annotation that allows a Java object to be serialized into a JSON file.
The annotation must accept as a parameter the directory where the resulting file will be saved.


## üì± Level 3
### Exercise 1
Enhances the custom annotation from the previous level so that it is retained at runtime.
Demonstrates how to read and act on the annotation using Java Reflection.
This proves that the annotation is accessible and processed dynamically by the JVM.

## üíª Technologies Used
- Java (SDK 17+)
- IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE
- No external libraries or build tools required

## üìã Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Java SDK **17+** or higher (SDK 23 was used during development)
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Git (optional, for version control)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this project, you **must first clone the repository locally**. Otherwise, you won't be able to open it correctly in IntelliJ IDEA.
To get a local copy of the project:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/maarselo/1.7-Annotations.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd 1.7-Annotations/
```

### üì• Cloning and Opening in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. On the welcome screen, click **"Clone Repository"** (Get from Version Control).
3. Paste the following URL into the **URL** field:
```bash
https://github.com/maarselo/1.7-Annotations
```
4. Choose the folder where the project should be saved.
5. Click **Clone**.

 if you already have it cloned, click on `Open` and select the local copy to open it. 

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

Each exercise has its own class and main method inside the appropriate package.
To run the program:

- Locate and open the class that contains the main() method
- Click the Run button, or press Shift + F10

You can also compile and run the project from the command line using javac and java if needed.

## üåê Deployment

This project is intended to run in a **local development environment** only.  
No production deployment configuration has been defined.

In the future, it could be extended into a GUI or web-based application for a better user experience.
